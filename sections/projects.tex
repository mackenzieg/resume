\subsection{{Microplastic Detection for Microbiologists \hfill 2020 --- 2022}}
%\subtext{Tesla \hfill California}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Device to help microbiologists detect microplastic to determine pollution in an ecosystem
\item Designed 6GHz cavity resonator for detecting changes in dielectric properties of microplastic suspended in microfluids
\item Simulated RF structures in Ansys HFSS with optimization; tested the device using VNA
\end{zitemize}

\subsection{{Fulltime Research for mmWave Radar Vital Sign Detection \hfill 2020 --- 2021}}
%\subtext{Tesla \hfill California}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Developed 60GHz mmWave Radar system for detecting breathing rate from a distance to aid nurses with highly infectious patients
\item Designed algorithm using Matlab with wavelet transformation and auto-correlation to detect breath rate at up to 10 meters
\item Implemented client-server architecture in Python and C++ to offload processing in realtime
\end{zitemize}
